"""
Nutrient-to-food lookup.

Each nutrient target maps to a hand-curated list of Indian foods.

DATA HONESTY (read before showing numbers to anyone):
  * `nutrient_value` is filled ONLY where the number was checked against the open
    Indian Nutrient Databank (INDB) ingredient tables (github.com/lindsayjaacks/
    Indian-Nutrient-Databank-INDB-: UK_fct.xlsx / US_fct.xlsx). Those foods carry
    source="INDB ..." . Everything else has no number on purpose.
  * `gi` values are approximate textbook figures; real GI varies with variety,
    ripeness and cooking. They are labelled source="approximate GI".
  * The raw IFCT 2017 tables must be requested from ICMR-NIN and are not in the repo,
    so most Indian staples cannot be number-checked yet.
  * Foods are suggestions for a class prototype, not medical or dietetic advice.

Two jobs:
  1. return the food list for each nutrient target;
  2. personalise it with the user's recent food log:
       - foods_to_add     -> hide things the user already eats
       - foods_to_reduce  -> keep them, and show the ones the user actually eats FIRST
